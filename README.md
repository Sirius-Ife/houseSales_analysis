# House Sales Data Analysis

The House Sales Data Analysis project focuses on analyzing and gaining insights from a dataset of house sales transactions. The project includes Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and regression analysis to understand the relationship between house prices and square footage of living space.

## Introduction

The House Sales Data Analysis project aims to explore patterns and trends in house sales data to better understand the factors influencing house prices. The project includes preprocessing of the dataset, exploratory analysis to uncover insights, and regression analysis to model the relationship between house prices and key features such as square footage of living space.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains information about house sales transactions, including features such as sale price, square footage of living space, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and other relevant attributes.

## Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves analyzing the dataset to summarize its main characteristics, often with visual methods. In this project, EDA was performed to understand the distribution of house prices, explore relationships between variables, and identify potential patterns or outliers in the data.

### Regression Analysis

Regression analysis was conducted to model the relationship between house prices and square footage of living space. This involved building regression models to predict house prices based on the square footage of living space, evaluating model performance, and interpreting the results to understand the impact of square footage on house prices.
